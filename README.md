# Express Note Taker

## Description

An application that can be used to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

This is my first project utilizing a server.  My initial focus was to build a functioning server with correct pathing functional use of GET, POST, and DELETE methods.  After building the server, I decided to work on separating out the routes to their own folder to clean up the application. Further improvements include separating a class constructor into it's own .js file in the db folder.  While servers and routing can be a challenging topic, it's an important skillset to develop!!
